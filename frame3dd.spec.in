%description
Free software for static and dynamic structural analysis of 2D and 3D frames 
and trusses with elastic and geometric stiffness. Computes the static
deflections, reactions, internal element forces, natural frequencies, mode
shapes and modal participation factors of two- and three- dimensional elastic
structures using direct stiffness and mass assembly.  Graphical output and
mode shape animation via Gnuplot version 4.0.

Requires: gnuplot, SoQT, Coin2.
