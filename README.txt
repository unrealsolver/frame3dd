FRAME3DD: a frame analysis program
-------------------------------

FRAME3DD is a program for the static and dynamic structural analysis of
two- and three-dimensional frames and trusses with elastic and 
geometric stiffness.

FRAME3DD reads an Input Data file, containing joint coordinates, member
geometry, material moduli, restrained joints, prescribed displacements,
load information, and optionally, mass information if a modal analysis
is to be carried out.

FRAME3DD appends results to an Output Data File, The Output Data 
recapitulates the input information, gives joint displacements in global 
coordinates, member end-forces in local coordinates, reactions in 
global coordinates, and natural frequencies and mode shapes in global 
coordinates.

For usage information, see the User Manual, included with both the source
code and binary installer packages.

Additional output files from FRAME3DD are directed by default to the temporary
file folder (according to the %TEMP% env var on Windows, or /tmp on other
platforms). You can specify an alternative location for output files by setting
the environment variable FRAME3DD_OUTDIR.

Note that you require write permissions for the input file in order that
FRAME3DD can append its calculation results to that file.
