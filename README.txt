FRAME: a frame analysis program
-------------------------------

FRAME is a program for the static and dynamic structural analysis of
two- and three-dimensional frames and trusses with elastic and 
geometric stiffness.

FRAME reads an Input Data file, containing joint coordinates, member
geometry, material moduli, restrained joints, prescribed displacements,
load information, and optionally, mass information if a modal analysis
is to be carried out.

FRAME appends the Input Data with Output Data, resulting in a single
Input/Output file. The Output Data recapitulates the input information,
gives joint displacements in global coordinates, member end-forces in
local coordinates, reactions in global coordinates, and natural
frequencies and mode shapes in global coordinates.
