Information for packaging FRAME3DD
==================================

Source tarball 
--------------

To build the source tarball from subversion:

  scons dist


RPM package
-----------

To build an RPM:

  scons dist
  rpmbuild -ta dist/frame3dd-*.tar.bz2

(Some values in ~/.rpmmacros may need to be set first)

Last tested with Fedora 9.


.DEB package
------------

To build a Debian package (e.g. suitable for Ubuntu), first get hold of the
'dtar' tool:

http://ascendwiki.cheme.cmu.edu/Building_a_Debian_package_from_a_source_tarball

Then, assuming you installed dtar somewhere on your path,

  cd ~/frame3dd
  scons dist
  dtar dist/frame3dd-0.20091020.tar.bz2 dist/debian.tar.gz

You should then have a .deb file in your ~/frame3dd directory. You can check
its contents using dpkg --contents *.deb. You can then install the package
using dpkg -i *.deb.

Note that this package includes the microstran parser and rendering/viewer
program, and as such, the package has numerous dependencies. We plan to 
separate this viewer into a subpackage, to allow the dependencies to be
minimised, but this has not been done just yet.


Windows installer
-----------------

To build a Windows installer (from MinGW/MSYS console):

  scons installer

You will need to have NSIS installed on your system. This is the program that
actually generates the installer -- SCons just 'oversees' the process.


Mac OS X package
----------------

Mac OS X package are not yet implemented. Hopefully coming soon. For now, use
the source tarball and build for yourself. SCons should first be installed using
'easy_install' using standard Mac Python (not Fink/MacPorts).


Releasing the files
-------------------

To upload files to Sourceforge.net for distribution:

  https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Release%20files%20for%20download
