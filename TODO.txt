TODO LIST for FRAME
-------------------

Convert 'save_matrix' to output files in Matrix Market format for easier
import into other programs.

Create structs to contain frame attributes, coordinates, etc, in order to 
migrate to a more object-oriented coding style, and simplify the passing
of parameters to functions.

Implement import of frames from other file formats. First one to try is the
Microstran '.arc' format. Imported will need to flag when the file contains
design features that can not be modelled in frame, for example tension-only
members, and probably others.

Consider making use of third-party matrix routines, rather to providing them
ourselves. Good options would be UMFPACK (for sparse matrices) or LAPACK (dense).

Implement an OpenGL browser for examining frames. GnuPlot has no opportunity
for GUI feedback eg click on a member to see its details, etc. Probably use can
be made of some higher-level toolkit for this eg VTK, OGRE, etc.
