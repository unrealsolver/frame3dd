TODO LIST for FRAME
-------------------

Convert 'save_matrix' to output files in Matrix Market format for easier
import into other programs.
http://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/

Create structs to contain frame attributes, coordinates, etc, in order to 
migrate to a more object-oriented coding style, and simplify the passing
of parameters to functions.

Implement import of Microstran .arc format. We can already parse these files
(including many constructs that aren't supported by FRAME) but we can not yet
actually calculate using the parsed data.

Consider making use of third-party matrix routines, rather to providing them
ourselves. Good options would be UMFPACK (for sparse matrices) or LAPACK (dense).
There would be assumed to be some efficiency improvements as a result of this
also, particularly if sparse matrix methods can be used.

Fix rendering of members with offsets specified in local coordinates (ie MOFF LO
statements).
