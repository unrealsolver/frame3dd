<B>Introduction</B>

<P>
This paper describes a solution to the following exercise: "Define a library
that makes it easy to write parsers directly in the language C". Note that it
says: "directly in the language", so no parser generator tools (like yacc) are
allowed. Note that it says "in the language C", which means not C++ or Java, so
no use of built-in objects or operators. (Later we will use some of the GCC
extensions, which are not part of ANSI C though.)

<P>
We are inspired by parser combinators in functional languages like Haskell, such
as Meijer's and Hutton's
<A HREF="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh/bib.html#monparsing">Monadic Parser
Combinators</A>, and Leijen's highly optimized
<A HREF="http://www.cs.uu.nl/~daan/parsec.html">Parsec</A>.

<P>
How can we express parsers like these in C? First of all, we need to find
alternatives in C for the two basic monadic parser operators: sequencing
and choice. Sequencing is done in Haskell by the monadic "bind":

<PRE>
<B>  (>>=) :: Parser a -> (a -> Parser b) -> Parser b
</B></PRE>

In C, using first class functions, such as the second argument to (<B>>>=</B>),
are really no possibility, so we will have to use a weaker variant of bind,
also called "then". Also, polymorphism is no real option in C, so we use a
specialized type for "then":

<PRE>
<B>  (>>) :: Parser () -> Parser () -> Parser ()
</B></PRE>

To pass information between parsers (which is done in Haskell using result
types), we will have to use side effects. This is however not as bad as
it sounds.

<P>
How do we implement this operator in C? For once, this operator should be lazy,
since the second argument to (<B>>></B>) should not be evaluated if the first
argument fails to parse the input. The only two operators which are lazy in C
are (<B>||</B>) and (<B>&&</B>). (The fact that they are lazy is a very common
source of errors among C programmers, so let us use this fact for once!)

<P>
So, if we represent parsers by C functions which always return the fact if
they succeeded or not, we can use (<B>&&</B>) for sequencing!

<P>
So how about choice? In Haskell, choice is represented by the (<B>+++</B>)
operator on parsers. Its specialized type is:

<PRE>
<B>  (+++) :: Parser () -> Parser () -> Parser ()
</B></PRE>

The obvious choice is to use the C operator (<B>||</B>) for this. In the
following, we describe how we want to write parsers in C using these operators.

<P>
<HR>

<P>
<B>Basic Parsing Operators</B>

<P>
In the following, we assume a basic C type <B>parse</B>. We also assume the
following operations on this type.

<PRE>
<B>  bool parseGetChar( parse *p, char *c );    <FONT COLOR="red">/* advancing */</FONT>
  bool parseUnGetChar( parse *p, char c );   <FONT COLOR="red">/* backing up */</FONT>
</B></PRE>

Keeping the type <B>parse</B> abstract means that we can implement
it in many different ways: reading input from a file, or advancing a pointer in
a string. What the best way is to implement this, depends on the application.

<P>
There are still two operations missing in order to provide a basic parsing library.
In Haskell, these functions are called <B>return</B> and <B>fail</B>. In order
to implement <B>return</B>, we need to be able to produce a result. But alas,
our parsers can only return a boolean result. Therefore, the real result of a
parser will be produces by assigning something to a variable. So, we
define the following macro in C:

<PRE>
<B>  <FONT COLOR="purple">#define</FONT> result(assignment)  (assignment,1)
</B></PRE>

(Unfortunately, the operator name <B>return</B> was already taken in C :-)
For example, <B>result( x = 3 )</B> is an expression which updates the result
<B>x</B> and as a parser, it always succeeds.

<P>
Similarly, to express <B>fail</B>, we define a macro that, as a parser, always
fails:

<PRE>
<B>  <FONT COLOR="purple">#define</FONT> fail  (0)
</B></PRE>

Finally, it is useful to have a conditional success or failure operation, which
is just the identity macro.

<PRE>
<B>  <FONT COLOR="purple">#define</FONT> condition(cond)  (cond)
</B></PRE>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
<B>Some Parser Examples</B>

<P>
Here are some examples of how to define more complicated parsers. First, we
define a parser which just parses any character and produces that as a result.

<PRE>
<B>  bool parseAChar( parse *p, char &c )
  { 
    <FONT COLOR="blue">return</FONT> ( parseGetChar( p, &c )
           );
  }
</B></PRE>

Simple enough, just a call to <B>parseGetChar</B>. (Note that every parser will
get the parser <B>p</B> as an argument. We could have solved this using a
global variable, but that would be bad programming even in C.)

<P>
Then, we define a parser which only parses a given character.

<PRE>
<B>  bool parseThisChar( parse *p, char c )
  { 
    char d;
    <FONT COLOR="blue">return</FONT> ( parseAChar( p, &d )
          && ( condition( c == d )
            || parseUnGetChar( p, d )
            && fail
             )
           );
  }
</B></PRE>

Note that in C, we have to be explicit about variable allocation. This parser
works as follows: It parsers an arbitrary character. If this succeeds, it checks
if it is the right character. If it is the wrong character, it puts the
character back and fails.

<P>
The idea is that all parsers we will construct will behave like this: If they
fail to parse, they will restore the state of the <B>parse</B> struct.
Unfortunately, this turns out to be a bit too restrictive. But it will be true
for all basic parsers we will construct.

<P>
Note that we use the C operator (<B>||</B>) to take care of failure of the
parser. Later we will see an example of using it for real choice. Another use of
it is for error messages.

<P>
Similarly, we can define a parser which only parses a digit, and produces that
as a result.

<PRE>
<B>  bool parseDigit( parse *p, char *c )
  { 
    <FONT COLOR="blue">return</FONT> ( parseAChar( p, c )
          && ( condition( '0' <= *c && *c <= '9' )
            || parseUnGetChar( p, *c )
            && fail
             )
           );
  }
</B></PRE>

We can see the subtle use of pointers to produce the result. Now, using
the parser for digits, we can define a parser which parses a number.

<PRE>
<B>  bool parseNumber( parse *p, int *n )
  { 
    char s[300];
    int i = 0;
    
    <FONT COLOR="blue">while</FONT> ( parseDigit( p, &(s[i]) )
         && result ( i++ )
          );
  
    <FONT COLOR="blue">return</FONT> ( condition ( i > 0 )
          && result ( s[i] = '\0' )
          && result ( *n = atoi( s ) )
           );
  }
</B></PRE>

Though relatively nice, it is a shame we had to split this up into two parts,
one in the while loop and the other one in the return statement. This is
because C makes a very silly distinction between statements and expressions,
which means that a while loop can not be part of the argument to return. In GCC
however, this restriction is lifted.

<P>
Thus, in GCC, we can define the familiar <B>many</B> combinator as follows:

<PRE>
<B>  <FONT COLOR="purple">#define</FONT> many(p)  ({while(p);1})
</B></PRE>

This means we can rewrite the number parser as follows:

<PRE>
<B>  bool parseNumber( parse *p, int *n )
  { 
    char s[300];
    int i = 0;
    
    <FONT COLOR="blue">return</FONT> ( many ( parseDigit( p, &(s[i]) )
                 && result ( i++ )
                  )
          && condition ( i > 0 )
          && result ( s[i] = '\0' )
          && result ( *n = atoi( s ) )
           );
  }
</B></PRE>


If we want to parse signed numbers (numbers with a <B>+</B> or a <B>-</B> in
front of it), we can do this as follows:

<PRE>
<B>  bool parseSignedNumber( parse *p, int *n )
  { 
    <FONT COLOR="blue">return</FONT> ( parseThisChar( p, '-' )
          && parseNumber( p, n )
          && result ( *n = -(*n) )

          || parseThisChar( p, '+' )
          && parseNumber( p, n )

          || parseNumber( p, n )
           );
  }
</B></PRE>

We can see that we use the (<B>||</B>) as a choice operator here. Now note that
this parser violates the condition we have stated above! If the input string
starts with a <B>+</B>, which is not followed by a number, the parser will fail
and not restore the input.

<P>
It turns out that the (<B>&&</B>) has the not-so-nice property of not keeping
the safety condition invariant. So we have to be careful using it. The safety
condition is necessary to guarantee proper backtracking when the wrong choice is
made. Usually, however, we define grammars which can be parsed in a
so-called predictive way: once we have taken a branch of a choice and have
initially parsed it successfully, we will stick to it and not backtrack.
This makes the use of (<B>&&</B>) a bit less painful.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Exercise:</B> Change the definition of <B>parseSignedNumber</B> so that it
does not violate the mentioned safety condition.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Here is another example of a parser. It removes spaces and C and C++ comments.

<PRE>
<B>  bool parseSpaceAndComments( parse *p )
  {
    <FONT COLOR="blue">return</FONT> ( many ( parseThisChar( p, ' ' )             
                 || parseThisChar( p, '\t' )
                 || parseThisChar( p, '\n' )

                 || parseThisString( p, "/*" )
                 && ( many ( !parseThisString( p, "*/" )
                          && parseAnyChar( p )
                           )
                    )

                 || parseThisString( p, "//" )
                 && ( many ( !parseThisChar( p, '\n' )
                          && parseAnyChar( p )
                           )
                    )
                  )
           );
  }
</B></PRE>

We use the parser <B>parseThisString</B>, which tries to parse a particular
string. It is defined as follows:

<PRE>
<B>  bool parseThisString( parse *p, char *s )
  { 
    int i = 0;
  
    <FONT COLOR="blue">return</FONT> ( many ( condition ( s[i] != '\0' )
                 && parseThisChar( p, s[i] )
                 && result ( i++ )
                  )
          && condition ( s[i] == '\0' )

          || many ( condition ( i-- >= 0 )
                 && parseUnGetChar( p, s[i] )
                  )
          && fail
           );
  }
</B></PRE>

Note that there is some work involved when cleaning up after failure.
