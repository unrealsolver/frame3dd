== PROP statement ==

Microstran has a section library, and sections are referred to by name, eg
'114.3X3.6CHS'. The .arc file format embeds some information about the section
to allow calculations without going back to the section library, namely
the cross sectional area, torsional modulus and second moments of area about
the two principle axes. There are two extra fields which have both been 0.000 
in the models I have seen so far.

Code:
 PROP     7 LIBR asw       114.3X3.6CHS    Y
      1.2500E-03  0.000      0.000     3.8400E-06 1.9200E-06 1.9200E-06

Interpretation:
 PROP propid source asw?   NAME            ???
       A_g         ?????      ?????     J          I_yy          I_xx

There is some support for custom sections also in place. Here is an example
of what that looks like:

 PROP     1 PRIS LH80603010x1.5  Lipped Hat G350
        2.9180E-04   0.000       0.000       0.000      2.8270E-07  4.0540E-07

In this case the 'Y' from the above (perhaps that is the member orientation?)
is replaced by a name for the section. The same properties appear to be
given on the following line.

We can see which of the 'I' is which using this output:

 PROP    43 LIBR asw       250UB37.3       Y default
       4.7500E-03  0.000      0.000     1.5800E-07 5.6600E-06 5.5700E-05

The values of 5.66 and 5.57, corresponding to I_yy and I_xx respectively, can 
be checked against the onesteel datasheet at:
