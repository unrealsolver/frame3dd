MICROSTRAN .ARC FILE FORMAT
---------------------------

This file documents the syntax of Microstran .arc files, which describe the
geometry and mechanical properties of structural space frames. These files can
be exported from Microstran, Multiframe and SpaceGASS structural analysis 
programs, which are popular in Australia and perhaps other places too.

As some sort of common interchange format, it made sense to write a parser for
these files so that they could (one day) be read and analysed by the free open
source program 'FRAME', of which the code in this directory is a part.

It is a working document. You may be able to glean further information by 
reading the code in the file 'modelparser.c' also in this directory.

== NODE statement ==

Nodes are specified by their location plus a bunch of flags.

	  + node ID (used in MEMB statments)
      |        + X
      |        |         + Y
      |        |         |           + Z
      |        |         |           |      + flags
      v        v         v           v      v
NODE  6340     4.6742    -4.6738     7.2825 000000

It's not clear yet what the purpose of the different flag bits might be. They
appear to be 0-1 values (no 2,4,8 that we've seen).

== MEMB statement ==

Members are specified in the MEMB statement, which looks like this:

      + member ID
      |      + from node ID
      |      |     + to node ID
      |      |     |      + alignment to +Z axis
      |      |     |      |     + corresponding section PROPerties
      |      |     |      |     |      + corresponding MATeriaL properties
      |      |     |      |     |      |    + a mysterious array of flags
      |      |     |      |     |      |    |
      v      v     v      v     v      v    v
MEMB  6025   643   637    Z     63     6    000000 000000

or

                          + node to which the member section is aligned
                          |
MEMB   805    42    49  2048     4     1    000000 000000

The 4th data field is the member alignment, which tells you which way the
member's principle axis is oriented; it can be to an axis of the global
coordinate system (first format) or to another (third) node in the structure
(second format).

It's not clear yet what the purpose of the MEMB flag bits might be, although
it may correspond to the degrees of freedom at either end of the member. They
appear to be 0-1 values (no 2,4,8 that we've seen).

== PROP statement ==

Microstran has a section library, and sections are referred to by name, eg
'114.3X3.6CHS'. The .arc file format embeds some information about the section
to allow calculations without going back to the section library, namely
the cross sectional area, torsional modulus and second moments of area about
the two principle axes. There are two extra fields which have both been 0.000 
in the models I have seen so far.

Code:
 PROP     7 LIBR asw       114.3X3.6CHS    Y
      1.2500E-03  0.000      0.000     3.8400E-06 1.9200E-06 1.9200E-06

Interpretation:
 PROP propid source asw?   NAME            ???
       A_g         ?????      ?????     J          I_yy          I_xx

There is some support for custom sections also in place. Here is an example
of what that looks like:

 PROP     1 PRIS LH80603010x1.5  Lipped Hat G350
        2.9180E-04   0.000       0.000       0.000      2.8270E-07  4.0540E-07

In this case the 'Y' from the above (perhaps that is the member orientation?)
is replaced by a name for the section. The same properties appear to be
given on the following line.

We can see which of the 'I' is which using this output:

 PROP    43 LIBR asw       250UB37.3       Y default
       4.7500E-03  0.000      0.000     1.5800E-07 5.6600E-06 5.5700E-05

The values of 5.66 and 5.57, corresponding to I_yy and I_xx respectively, can 
be checked against the onesteel datasheet at:
http://onesteel.com/images/db_images/productspecs/sectpropub1203.pdf

== MATL statement ==

This statement gives the material properties for the sections. For example,

 MATL    1 2.000E+08 2.500E-01 7.850E+00 1.170E-05
         ^   ^       ^         ^         ^
         |   |       |         |         + beta? (not sure about this one)
         |   |       |         + rho, material density
         |   |       + sigma_y, yeild stress
		 |   + young's modulus
         + MATL ID code (used in MEMB statements)
